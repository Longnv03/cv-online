                    I am very excited to study in college, especially at RMIT, because RMIT is a new environment, new opportunity, and new difficulties, which make my sense of triumph arise in order to conquer it. To be honest, I am an outdoorsman who spends a lot of time at the football field every afternoon until the sun goes down. Bowling is also one of my favourite sports, which I usually play when I want to rewind after a hard-working day. I like studying and discussing AI technology, mainly when people use it for healthcare treatment. I had seen doctors use robots to monitor conditions, deliver medications to patients, and use them to transport medical equipment and do physical work in a day while I volunteered at the hospital. And that gave me the passion and motivation to learn more about AI technology and use it to improve people's health, especially people with disabilities. "Simple but significant" and "Hard-working" are the two main things I always follow when I do work or do activities, and I also applied that when studying Information Technology. That's the motivation to achieve my goals and the driving force for me to succeed in life.

I usually go to the swimming pool near my house, which is in Linh Dam because it is very convenient. It helps me to improve my health, increase height, and get in shape. Moreover, swimming pool is my favorite place to go when I want to cool off on hot days and enjoy the massage in the saunas near it.</p>
